2. **Memory Usage**:
   - Available memory
   - Used memory
   - Memory percentage
   - Swap usage

3. **Disk I/O**:

## Test Execution Order

### Recommended Sequence
1. **Setup**: Reset and seed database
2. **01_Authors_GET_All.jmx** - Baseline read performance
3. **02_Authors_GET_ById.jmx** - Single record retrieval
4. **03_Authors_POST_Create.jmx** - Create load test
5. **04_Authors_PUT_Update.jmx** - Update load test
6. **06_Books_GET_All.jmx** - Books read performance
7. **07_Books_GET_ById.jmx** - Single book retrieval
8. **08_Books_POST_Create.jmx** - Books create load test
9. **09_Books_PUT_Update.jmx** - Books update load test
10. **05_Authors_DELETE.jmx** - Author deletion (requires recreation)
11. **10_Books_DELETE.jmx** - Book deletion (requires recreation)

**Note**: DELETE tests should be run last as they modify the test data set.

## Notes
- Database should be reset before each test run for consistent results
- The Python profiling script requires `pandas` and `matplotlib` packages
- All tests target `http://localhost:50524` by default
- Test duration and thread counts can be adjusted based on performance requirements
- CSV data files should be properly formatted and contain sufficient test data
